<p> Clare Hollingworth (10 October 1911 – 10 January 2017) was an English journalist and author. She was the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent"> war correspondent</a> to report the outbreak of World War II, described as <b>"the scoop of the century"</b>. As a reporter for The Daily Telegraph in 1939, while travelling from Poland to Germany she spotted and reported German forces massed on the Polish border; three days later she was the first to report the German invasion of Poland. Hollingworth was found unresponsive in her flat at Hong Kong on 10 January 2017 and was confirmed dead shortly; she was 105. </p>

    <li> <b>1963</b> - She was in Beirut and began to investigate Kim Philby, an Observer correspondent, discovering that he had departed for Odessa on a Soviet ship. The Guardian's editor, Alastair Hetherington, fearing legal action, held up the story of Philby's defection for three months, before publishing her detailed account on 27 April 1963. His defection was subsequently confirmed by the government.She was appointed the Guardian's defence correspondent in 1963, the first woman in the role. </li>

    <li> <b>1943</b> - She was ordered to return to Cairo. Wishing to remain at the front lines, she went on to cover General Dwight D.

During this time she became the first to interview the Shah of Iran. </li>

    <li> <b>1941</b> - She went to Egypt, and subsequently reported from Turkey, Greece and Cairo. Her efforts were hampered by the fact that women war correspondents did not receive formal accreditation. </li>

    <li> <b>1911</b> - Hollingworth was born in Knighton, a southern suburb of Leicester.

<q><i> I must admit that I enjoy being in a war,” says Hollingworth. “When we were small children, my father used to take us to the Battle of Bosworth Field. When I was very small, in World War One, I used to hear people talk about the battles, and I did become extremely interested in warfare. I’m not brave, I just enjoy it.</i></q>
